    <p class="mb-0"> INTRODUCTION
    Anthropogenic climate change is expected to increase the frequency, intensity, and du-
    ration of heat waves (IPCC Report, 2021). The boreal summer of 2023 was the fifth
    warmest on record, 0.83 ◦C higher than the 1991-2020 average of 19.63 ◦C (Copernicus
    Climate Change Service, 2023). Urban areas are increasingly experiencing the impacts of
    heat extremes (Lorenz et al., 2019), particularly through the phenomenon known as the
    Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect (Oke, 2006). This effect causes urban areas to become
    significantly warmer than their rural surroundings due to human activities, dense infras-
    tructure, and land-use changes. The warming effect is further exacerbated during the
    night, as urban areas retain heat more effectively than rural areas, leading to increased
    human heat stress and causing serious risks to public health (Cheval et al., 2024), includ-
    ing a higher risk of mortality (Huang et al., 2023).
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
    People living in urban areas are highly affected by the UHI effect through thermal stress
    (Burger et al., 2021; Wicki et al., 2018). Given that more than 75 % of the Central Eu-
    ropean population resides in urban areas, this increasing trend poses one of the major
    weather-related threats to people in these environments (Wicki et al., 2018). To miti-
    gate threats to public health, detailed knowledge of temperature distribution is necessary
    (Zumwald et al., 2021). One of the most effective methods for monitoring urban heat
    stress is through detailed heat-maps, which visualize temperature variations across a city
    (Zumwald et al., 2021; Völkel and Shandas, 2021). These maps are essential for effective
    urban planning and public health interventions; however, their accuracy often depends
    on costly automated weather stations (AWS) to capture temperature data (Gubler et al.,
    2021) and on the models used.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">   
    To capture small-scale temperature changes in a city, a climatically complex area, high
    spatial resolution measurement networks are needed. Gubler et al. (2021) pioneered this
    approach by developing low-cost devices (LCDs) to build an extensive temperature net-
    work in the city of Bern, Switzerland. The LCDs consist of a temperature logger and
    a custom-made, naturally ventilated radiation shield. In 2023, Gabriel Erisman, a Mas-
    ter’s student at the Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research, University of Bern,
    Switzerland, set up a monitoring network in the city of Biel, Switzerlan as part of his
    thesis, similar to the one in Bern. The network in Biel consists of 39 LCDs covering all
    occurring local climate zones (LCZs) according to Oke and Stewart (2012). The temporal
    resolution of the network is set at 10-minute intervals, while the spatial resolution varies
    significantly depending on the location of the LCDs (approx. 50 m to 2000 m). The data
    in the LCDs must be read out manually every month.</p>

        <p class="card-text">    Weather information is important for many aspects from everyday life to spatial planning and climate change adaptation.
            Reconstructions of past weather extend our knowledge by covering a larger time window, which is particularly important
            for extremes. On this site you can learn step-by-step how historical manuscript data can eventually
            lead to complex climate information such as hazard maps.</p>
