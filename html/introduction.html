    <p class="mb-0">Students are able to comprehend step by step the process of generating value-added climate information from raw measurements. They can point to sources of uncertainty and are able to use reanalysis data and other data products in a meaningful way.</p>

        <p class="card-text">    Weather information is important for many aspects from everyday life to spatial planning and climate change adaptation.
            Reconstructions of past weather extend our knowledge by covering a larger time window, which is particularly important
            for extremes. On this site you can learn step-by-step how historical manuscript data can eventually
            lead to complex climate information such as hazard maps.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Structure</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The site is structured in three modules or areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Climate Data</li>
            <li>Global Reanalyses</li>
            <li>Downscaling and Applications</li>
        </ul>
        <small class="text-muted">Each starts with an entry page with a very short text and the
            video, then follow 2-4 subsections, typically each with an exercise.</small>
