            Reanalyses are consistent with the observations and with the model physics – they
            are best estimates of the atmospheric state. However, this does not guarantee
            that they are correct or even useful, particularly far away from observation
            locations or for derived variables. Because reanalyses provide all variables everywhere
            and always, it is tempting to use them for all sorts of applications. But they
            may not be suitable for your application. Understanding how the data set is
            generated is therefore important, and dealing with the massive amount of data also is a
            challenge.

            The best training is to explore that data sets.
            For the historical reanalysis CERA-20C, which is generated from the assimilation
            of surface pressure and marine wind data into a forecast model, an interactive
            visualization can be found here <a href="http://earth.fdn-dev.iwi.unibe.ch/" target="_blank">http://earth.fdn-dev.iwi.unibe.ch</a>.
            The exercise bellow asks you to explore some specific aspects.

        Using the visualization <a href="http://earth.fdn-dev.iwi.unibe.ch/" target="_blank">http://earth.fdn-dev.iwi.unibe.ch</a>
        and your knowledge of the generation of the data set, answer the following questions:
        How much precipitation fell over northern Italy on 12 Dec 1916, 0 UTC within 3 hours?
    </p>

    <p class="card-text">
        For 21 January 1928, 12 UTC, consider pressure over Europe, temperature over Eastern Siberia and total cloud water over Fiji Islands. Which do you trust most and why?
    </p>

    <p class="card-text">
        Where was wind speed highest on 12 June 1916, 12 UTC? Do you trust this value? Is it physically plausible?
